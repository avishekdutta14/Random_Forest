# Random_Forest
These scripts are for random forest (RF) classification (RF_classification.R) and regression (RF_regression.R). These scripts have three sections viz. 1) training/running the RF model, 2) testing the accuracy of the models, and 3) assessing variable importance

Detailed description of the scripts and outputs are present in the following links:

1) RF-classification: https://avishekdutta14.github.io/rfc/
2) RF- regression: https://avishekdutta14.github.io/rfr/

The paprica_to_rf.R script is for converting paprica outputs to RF inputs. Please go through the script for additional details about what paprica files you can use as an input to this script.
